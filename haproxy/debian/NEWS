haproxy (1.8.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  In order to upgrade to the HAProxy 1.8 new process model, a full service
  restart will be performed automatically on upgrade from pre-1.8 versions
  when running under systemd. This incurs (minimal) service downtime and
  will only be performed once; future upgrades will reload haproxy seamlessly.

haproxy (1.4.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of 1.4.23-1, the Debian package ships an rsyslog snippet to allow logging
  via /dev/log from chrooted HAProxy processes. If you are using rsyslog, you
  should restart rsyslog after installing this package to enable HAProxy to log
  via rsyslog. See /usr/share/doc/haproxy/README.Debian for more details.

  Also note that as of 1.4.23-1, chrooting the HAProxy process is enabled in the
  default Debian configuration.

  Configuration has moved to /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.  This allows to add the
  configurable /etc/haproxy/errors directory.
  The haproxy binary was also moved to /usr/sbin rather than /usr/bin, update
  your init script or reinstall the one provided with the package.
