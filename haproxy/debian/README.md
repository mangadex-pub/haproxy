# About Debian packaging

This folder is a slightly modified version of the Debian HAProxy Team's work and
essentially all credits is due to them.

It is sourced
from [haproxy-team/haproxy:experimental-2.6](https://salsa.debian.org/haproxy-team/haproxy/-/tree/experimental-2.6)
and will be updated every now and then.

And by that I mean that I hope someone with more experience and time in
packaging Debian archives (*wink wink, HAProxy Debian team*) figures out a
long-term solution equivalent to this repository as a whole.
